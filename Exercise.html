<h1>The Best Movies according to Tawsif</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.</p>

<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>The 1970s setting is so well done, and the haunted house feels like a character in itself with all its creepy corners and eerie atmosphere. It draws you into the story and makes everything feel more real. Overall, The Conjuring is a fantastic horror movie that I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good scare.</p>

<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>James Wan's horror film Saw is full of demented twists and guilty-looking actors, but the scenario is cruel enough to make you squirm.</p>
